  <p>This small ({{site.data.shoe-rack.length}}cm x
  {{site.data.shoe-rack.end_height}}cm x
  {{site.data.shoe-rack.end_depth}}cm) shelving unit can conveniently
  organize shoes in a closet or entryway. Its light, open design
  allows for plenty of air cirulation. The lower shelves are tilted
  downward in the front, to make shoes resting on them easier to see
  and grab. The top shelf is flat, making it a great place to store
  tall boots or shoes in boxes.</p>

  <p>As the unit is not designed to hold heavy objects, it can be
  assembled without fasteners. If cuts are made carefully, so that the
  components fit flushly, only glue is needed to hold them
  together. If you plan on loading the shelves with more heavy
  objects, consider adding screws, dowels, or other fasteners to the
  joints in the end pieces, as well as the points where the shelf
  supports are fastened to the ends.</p>

  <p>The ribs in the centers of the shelves help keep the slats
  aligned in spite of seasonal wood movement. On a narrower version of
  this unit, the ribs may not be needed. On a wider version, consider
  additional ribs.</p>

<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    Prepare half-lap joints in the ends by removing half the thickness
    ({{site.data.shoe-rack.lap_joint_depth}}cm) from one face of both
    ends of each board, to a distance equal to the width of the board
    ({{site.data.shoe-rack.end_stock_width}}cm). It's best to sneak up
    on this cut, to get the fit as close as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're using power tools, set up a stop block to mark the width
    of the cut. Make the cut in one end of two pieces, then check
    their fit. If either the width or the depth is too short, adjust
    the stop block or the depth of the cutter, then cut that same
    joint again. Continue this cycle until that joint is flush, cut
    the ends of the other boards without moving the stop block or the
    cutter further.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're using handtools, it's best to work on a single pair of
    ends at a time, and marks those ends to ensure that they remain
    paired, as each joint is likely to fit ever so slightly
    differently.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you cut too far, don't fret - you have many options, without
    resorting to cutting new pieces from scratch. But make sure you
    choose the same option for all eight joints, so that the ends
    still come out square.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      For very small errors in either dimension, just forget about
      them, and sand, plane, or scrape the protruding lip off after
      assembly. It's common to purposely make this mistake to ensure
      that ends meet faces exactly.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the width is several millimeters or more off, you may need to
      consider adjusting the depth of your shelves, or their
      spacing. The ends will be smaller than expected.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the depth is far enough to cause a millimeter or more to sit
      proud of the joint, you can either thin the pieces before
      assembly (take material out of the portion of the piece between
      the cut areas), or fashion a shim that accounts for the loss
      exactly. A shim in a contrasting color might even create a fun
      visual accent to the unit.
    </li>
    <li>
      For either large error, you can also glue a bit of stock into
      the over-cut area to make up for the loss. To get an exact fit,
      you may want to glue more than was lost, and then recut through
      the shim.
    </li>
  </ul>

    Glue and clamp the end assemblies together. One

    two {{site.data.shoe-rack.end_height}}cm pieces. You should end up
    with two separate rectangular assemblies.
  </p>
  <p>
    To ensure that each end is square, measure diagonally from one
    corner, across the end to the other corner. Then measure the
    opposite two corners. If the measurements match, the piece is
    square. If they don't match, apply a little pressure to squeeze
    the farther corners toward each other, and then measure again.

  <p>
    Set the end assemblies aside to dry while working on the rest of
    the pieces.

  <h3>Making the Shelves</h3>

{% include figure.html number=figure_cut_slats
image="view-slat-dimensions.png"
caption="Cut the slats for the shelves." %}
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    You will need {{site.data.shoe-rack.total_slats}} slats, each
    {{site.data.shoe-rack.slat_length}}cm long,
    {{site.data.shoe-rack.slat_stock_width}}cm wide, and
    {{site.data.shoe-rack.slat_stock_thickness}}cm thick. A good way
    to make these is to find a long board that is
    {{site.data.shoe-rack.slat_stock_width}}cm thick, then set a power
    saw fence {{site.data.shoe-rack.slat_stock_thickness}}cm away from
    its blade, and cut several strips along the length of the board.
    Also cut enough extra strips to use as center supports in the next
    step.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have enough strips, cut them into
    {{site.data.shoe-rack.slat_length}}cm sections.  While cutting the
    slats to exactly {{site.data.shoe-rack.slat_length}}cm will ensure
    that the unit is exactly {{site.data.shoe-rack.length}}cm wide, it
    is far more important to make sure that the slats are all exactly
    the same length, regardless what that length is. If the slats are
    slightly different lengths, your shelves may be slightly different
    lengths, or the slats will stick out past their supports. If
    either of these happens, it will not be possible to assemble the
    unit.
  </p>
</div>

{% capture step_cut_supports %}{% increment sr_step %}{% endcapture %}
{% include step_heading.html number=step_cut_supports

{% include figure.html number=figure_cut_supports

caption="Shelf support detail." %}
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <!-- TODO need logic to say or not say this, depending on
      reduce_unique parts and given shelf angles.  -->
  <p>
    For each shelf, cut two end supports and one center support to the
    length given in {% include figure_link.html
    number=figure_cut_supports %} (between
    {{site.data.shoe-rack.shallowest_shelf_depth}}cm and
    {{site.data.shoe-rack.deepest_shelf_depth}}cm, depending on
    mounting angle). The end supports are made of the same stock that
    the ends were made of, and the center support is made from the
    same stock as the slats.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, cut rebates for the slats to fit into. The positions of the
    rebates are symmetrical about the center of the shelf. This means
    that if you're using a jig (with a table saw or router table, for
    example), you can cut two rebates in the correct positions by
    cutting one, then flipping the piece around and cutting the
    second. Note that for shelves that will be mounted at greater than
    {{site.data.shoe-rack.raised_front_slat_min_angle}}, no rebate is
    cut for the front slat. This will leave the front slat sitting
    higher that the others, to provide a small lip to keep shoes from
    sliding off.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, ease the front and back of the shelf support by cutting
    off the lower corner, as shown in {% include figure_link.html
    number=figure_cut_supports %}. This cut is most important for the
    back of the shelf, to keep the corner from sticking out of the
    rear of the unit. Matching the mounting angle makes it easy to
    align the shelf during assembly, but is not required. Cutting the
    angle on the front side gives the front of the unit a more open
    look.
  </p>
</div>

caption="Cut the bottom shelf even with the floor." %}
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    The supports for the bottom shelf need to be further trimmed so
    that they don't stick out from the bottom. Cut an angle
    {{site.data.shoe-rack.bottom_shelf_mounting_angle}}&deg; from the
    top edge of two supports, starting at the front corner.
  </p>
  <p>
    This can be a difficult cut to make, because it's such a small
    angle. If you have a tapering jig - the kind that would normally
    be used for table legs - I'd suggest using that. Otherwise,
    cutting close with a handsaw or jigsaw, then flattening to the
    line with sandpaper or a handplane might be your best bet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another alternative is to delay this step until after
    assembly. Once the shelf is glued in position, a flush-cut saw
    could be used to trim the protrusion even with the endpiece it's
    glued to. The center support, especially, might be done more
    easily with a sanding block after assembly.

  <p>
    When you have enough clamps free (either immediately, or when the

    support, and attach it in the same manner to the opposite end of
    the slats.

    Apply glue to the rebates of the center support, and fit it onto
    the slats. A few light pencil marks in the middle of the slats and
    the middle of the center support can also help with
    alignment. This may be a tricky process if the slats have any
    curve at all, or if the rebates are not aligned exactly. A clamp
    with a screwed jaw can be helpful to apply pressure to seat each
    slat. Clamp the support in place while the glue dries.

    If the front slat for this shelf does not have a rebate, attach it

    When all of the glue on the ends and the shelves has dried, it's
    time to put them together. Unclamp everything, and clean up any
    glue that squeezed out of the joints. Now is also a good time to
    plane down the ends of any slats sticking past the sends of the
    shelf supports, and to plane the lap joints flush in the end
    assemblies.

  <p>
    Lay one end assembly flat. Place one shelf at a time on-end on
    this end assembly, and mark lightly with a pencil where the shelf
    sits. Also mark on the shelf support where it contacts the end
    assembly. Repeat this procedure using the other end assembly, but
    be sure to flip the shelves over!
  </p>
  <p>
    Apply glue between your marks on one end assembly, and to that
    side of each shelf, then clamp each shelf in place on the end
    assembly. One clamp on the front, and one clamp on the back of
    each shelf should suffice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of laying the end assembly on my work table, I found it
    easier to clamp the end assembly to a narrow work stand. This
    allowed me to reach underneath to mark the shelf supports, and
    gave plenty of room for the clamps to reach.

    For the second side, apply glue between all marks on the second
    end assembly, and to all shelf ends at once, then set the assembly
    in place on top of the shelves still standing in the air. Clamp
    each shelf into place, aligning them with the marks made earlier,

    Assembly is complete. It's a good idea to finish the shoe rack
    with something that will provide it with some protection against
