  <p>This small ({{length}}cm x {{endHeight}}cm x {{endDepth}}cm)
  shelving unit can conveniently organize shoes in a closet or
  entryway. Its light, open design allows for plenty of air
  cirulation. The lower shelves are tilted downward in the front, to
  make shoes resting on them easier to see and grab. The top shelf is
  flat, making it a great place to store tall boots or shoes in
  boxes.</p>

  <p>As the unit is not designed to hold heavy objects, it can be
  assembled without fasteners. If cuts are made carefully, so that the
  components fit flushly, only glue is needed to hold them
  together. If you plan on loading the shelves with more heavy
  objects, consider adding screws, dowels, or other fasteners to the
  joints in the end pieces, as well as the points where the shelf
  supports are fastened to the ends.</p>

  <p>The ribs in the centers of the shelves help keep the slats
  aligned in spite of seasonal wood movement. On a narrower version of
  this unit, the ribs may not be needed. On a wider version, consider
  additional ribs.</p>
