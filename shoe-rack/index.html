  <p>This small ({{length}}cm x {{endHeight}}cm x {{endDepth}}cm)
  shelving unit can conveniently organize shoes in a closet or
  entryway. Its light, open design allows for plenty of air
  cirulation. The lower shelves are tilted downward in the front, to
  make shoes resting on them easier to see and grab. The top shelf is
  flat, making it a great place to store tall boots or shoes in
  boxes.</p>

  <p>As the unit is not designed to hold heavy objects, it can be
  assembled without fasteners. If cuts are made carefully, so that the
  components fit flushly, only glue is needed to hold them
  together. If you plan on loading the shelves with more heavy
  objects, consider adding screws, dowels, or other fasteners to the
  joints in the end pieces, as well as the points where the shelf
  supports are fastened to the ends.</p>

  <p>The ribs in the centers of the shelves help keep the slats
  aligned in spite of seasonal wood movement. On a narrower version of
  this unit, the ribs may not be needed. On a wider version, consider
  additional ribs.</p>

</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    Prepare half-lap joints in the ends by removing half the thickness
    ({{lapJointDepth}}cm) from one face of both ends of each board, to
    a distance equal to the width of the board
    ({{endStockWidth}}cm). It's best to sneak up on this cut, to get
    the fit as close as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're using power tools, set up a stop block to mark
    the width of the cut. Make the cut in one end of two pieces, then
    check their fit. If either the width or the depth is too short,
    adjust the stop block or the depth of the cutter, then cut that
    same joint again. Continue this cycle until that joint is flush,
    cut the ends of the other boards without moving the stop block or
    the cutter further.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're using handtools, it's best to work on a single pair of
    ends at a time, and marks those ends to ensure that they remain
    paired, as each joint is likely to fit ever so slightly
    differently.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you cut too far, don't fret - you have many options, without
    resorting to cutting new pieces from scratch. But make sure you
    choose the same option for all eight joints, so that the ends
    still come out square.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      For very small errors in either dimension, just forget about
      them, and sand, plane, or scrape the protruding lip off after
      assembly. It's common to purposely make this mistake to ensure
      that ends meet faces exactly.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the width is several millimeters or more off, you may need to
      consider adjusting the depth of your shelves, or their
      spacing. The ends will be smaller than expected.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the depth is far enough to cause a millimeter or more to sit
      proud of the joint, you can either thin the pieces before
      assembly (take material out of the portion of the piece between
      the cut areas), or fashion a shim that accounts for the loss
      exactly. A shim in a contrasting color might even create a fun
      visual accent to the unit.
    </li>
    <li>
      For either large error, you can also glue a bit of stock into
      the over-cut area to make up for the loss. To get an exact fit,
      you may want to glue more than was lost, and then recut through
      the shim.

  </p>
  <p>
    To ensure that each end is square, measure diagonally from one
    corner, across the end to the other corner. Then measure the
    opposite two corners. If the measurements match, the piece is
    square. If they don't match, apply a little pressure to squeeze
    the farther corners toward each other, and then measure again.

    Set the end assemblies aside to dry while working on the rest of

  <h3>Making the Shelves</h3>

<div class="pure-u-1">
  <h4 id="step4">Step 4: Cut the slats.</h4>

  </a>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    You will need {{totalSlats}} slats, each {{slatLength}}cm long,
    {{slatStockWidth}}cm wide, and {{slatStockThickness}}cm thick. A
    good way to make these is to find a long board that is
    {{slatStockWidth}}cm thick, then set a power saw fence
    {{slatStockThickness}}cm away from its blade, and cut several
    strips along the length of the board.  Also cut enough extra
    strips to use as center supports in the next step.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have enough strips, cut them into {{slatLength}}cm
    sections.  While cutting the slats to exactly {{slatLength}}cm
    will ensure that the unit is exactly {{length}}cm wide, it is far
    more important to make sure that the slats are all exactly the
    same length, regardless what that length is. If the slats are
    slightly different lengths, your shelves may be slightly different
    lengths, or the slats will stick out past their supports. If
    either of these happens, it will not be possible to assemble the
    unit.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1">
  <h4 id="step5">Step 5: Shape the shelf supports.</h4>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <a id="figure6">
    <img class="pure-img"
         src="view-shelf-support-detail.png"
         alt="Figure 6: Shelf support detail." />
    <p><i>Figure 6: Shelf support detail.</i></p>
  </a>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <!--
      TODO need logic to say or not say this, depending on
      reduceUnique parts and given shelf angles.
    -->
  <p>
    For each shelf, cut two end supports and one center support to the
    length given in <a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a> (between
    {{shallowestShelfDepth}}cm and {{deepestShelfDepth}}cm, depending
    on mounting angle). The end supports are made of the same stock
    that the ends were made of, and the center support is made from
    the same stock as the slats.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, cut rebates for the slats to fit into. The positions of the
    rebates are symmetrical about the center of the shelf. This means
    that if you're using a jig (with a table saw or router table, for
    example), you can cut two rebates in the correct positions by
    cutting one, then flipping the piece around and cutting the
    second. Note that for shelves that will be mounted at greater than
    {{raisedFrontSlatMinAngle}}, no rebate is cut for the front
    slat. This will leave the front slat sitting higher that the
    others, to provide a small lip to keep shoes from sliding off.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, ease the front and back of the shelf support by cutting
    off the lower corner, as shown in <a href="#figure6">Figure
    6</a>. This cut is most important for the back of the shelf, to
    keep the corner from sticking out of the rear of the
    unit. Matching the mounting angle makes it easy to align the shelf
    during assembly, but is not required. Cutting the angle on the
    front side gives the front of the unit a more open look.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1">
  <h4 id="step6">Step 6: Cut the bottom off the bottom supports.</h4>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <a id="figure7">

    <p><i>Figure 7: Cut the bottom shelf even with the floor.</i></p>
  </a>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    The supports for the bottom shelf need to be further trimmed so
    that they don't stick out from the bottom. Cut an angle
    {{bottomShelfMountingAngle}}&deg; from the top edge of two
    supports, starting at the front corner.
  </p>
  <p>
    This can be a difficult cut to make, because it's such a small
    angle. If you have a tapering jig - the kind that would normally
    be used for table legs - I'd suggest using that. Otherwise,
    cutting close with a handsaw or jigsaw, then flattening to the
    line with sandpaper or a handplane might be your best bet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another alternative is to delay this step until after
    assembly. Once the shelf is glued in position, a flush-cut saw
    could be used to trim the protrusion even with the endpiece it's
    glued to. The center support, especially, might be done more
    easily with a sanding block after assembly.

    When you have enough clamps free (either immediately, or when the

    Apply glue to the rebates of the center support, and fit it onto

    the middle of the center support can also help with
    alignment. This may be a tricky process if the slats have any
    curve at all, or if the rebates are not aligned exactly. A clamp
    with a screwed jaw can be helpful to apply pressure to seat each
    slat. Clamp the support in place while the glue dries.

    When all of the glue on the ends and the shelves has dried, it's
    time to put them together. Unclamp everything, and clean up any
    glue that squeezed out of the joints. Now is also a good time to
    plane down the ends of any slats sticking past the sends of the
    shelf supports, and to plane the lap joints flush in the end
    assemblies.

    Lay one end assembly flat. Place one shelf at a time on-end on

    Apply glue between your marks on one end assembly, and to that

    Instead of laying the end assembly on my work table, I found it
    easier to clamp the end assembly to a narrow work stand. This

    end assembly, and to all shelf ends at once, then set the assembly
