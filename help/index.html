  <h3>How do I use these plans?</h3>
  <p>The plans are mostly drawings indicating the size and shape of
  the piece of the project, and showing some of how they fit
  together. How to interpret each of the drawings is discussed
  below. Step-by-step instructions for how to shape and assemble each
  piece are not always included. If there's a step you'd like guidance
  on, please visit
  the <a href="https://github.com/beerriot/woodworking-plans/">GitHub
  repository</a>, and file an issue asking for it.</p>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1">
  <h3>What is this drawing with three items set near each other?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <img class="pure-img" src="view-book-third-angle.png" />
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>This diagram is called
  a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiview_projection#Third-angle_projection">third-angle
  projection</a>. It displays an object as if you were looking at it
  from three perspectives at once. In counter-clockwise order, they
  are the view from above, the view from the front, and the view from
  the right side. While the "3D" view seen elsewhere can be useful for
  getting a "feel" of the object, the third-angle view makes it easier
  to clearly label dimensions.</p>
  <p>The examle here is hopefully recognizable as hard-cover
  book. From the front, you can see the title on the cover. From the
  top, you can see pages inside the cover, and the spine on the left
  side. From the right, you can see the pages between the front and
  back covers.</p>
  <p>Occasionally you'll find a diagram like this has only two views:
  front and right. That's because the top view doesn't add anything
  interesting, so it has been omitted to reduce visual noise.</p>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1">
  <h3>What is this bar with a number near it?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <img class="pure-img" src="view-size-label.png" />
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>This marker labels a dimension. The distance, in centimeters,
  between the short lines at the ends of the bar is equal to the
  number near the bar. The example bar here shows 10cm. (Note: the bar
  is unlikely to be 10cm long on your display - it is only indicating
  scale.)</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <img class="pure-img" src="view-angle-label.png" />
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>This marker labels an angle. The angle is measured from the
  straight arm to the end of the arc, with the pivot point being at
  the end opposite the number (the end on the inside of the arc's
  curve). The number is gives the size of the angle in degrees.</p>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1">
  <h3>What is this diagram with names and numbers in parentheses?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <img class="pure-img" src="view-key.png" />
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>This is what I call the "key". Like a key on a map, this diagram
  displays the name of each component next to an example of the
  component. The number in parentheses is how many of that component
  there are in the piece.</p>
  <p>The example here says we'll need one BOOK an three PENCILs.</p>

  <h3>How do I change the dimensions of the project?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
  <p>Changing the dimensions, or other design aspects, of the project
  currently requires you to install and get familiar with some
  software. The files used to generate the diagrams here are
  open-source. Visit
  the <a href="https://github.com/beerriot/woodworking-plans/">GitHub
  repository</a> to download them. Instructions for modifying the
  models and regenerating the diagrams are included there.</p>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1">
  <h3>How precise are these measurements?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
  <p>All measurements are computed from a model. From that perspective,
  they are exact.</p>
  <p>All measurements have been rounded to the nearest tenth of a
  millimeter, to limit display space. From that perspective, they
  might be up to 50 micrometers off (just under 0.002 inches).</p>
  <p>The real world imparts error into any measurement. Tools cut just
  a hair wider or narrower than expected. Wood swells and shrinks with
  the seasons. Small differences are noticable in some places, but not
  others. My advice is to treat the measurement given here as correct,
  but do not discount what you observe when measuring in your
  shop. Sometimes a 1cm tenon fits a 1cm mortise, sometimes it needs a
  light sand, sometimes the swell from the moisture in the glue solves
  the wiggle.</p>
