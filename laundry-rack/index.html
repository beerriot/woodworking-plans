    Hanging wet laundry to dry uses less energy, and is gentler on
    clothing, than heated tumble drying. This rack provides ample
    space to hang several loads, while also folding near-flat for
    storage.

    Step-by-step instructions for building this laundry rack
    follow. <a href="">A video of this process</a> is also available
    on YouTube.

    These instructions assume that your square stock (for the legs and
    arms) and the dowels are already the correct width and thickness
    (Legs/arms: {{squareStockWidth}}cm x {{squareStockThickness}}cm,
    dowels {{dowelDiameter}}cm in
    diameter). (<a href="#figure0">Figure 0</a>) The dimensions in
    these plans are the dimensions of commonly-available surfaced
    stock from major hardware stores. If you're starting with
    differently-sized wood, rip the square stock and turn the dowels
    to size before starting.

    If you want the dowels in the arms to hang at exactly the height
    shown in the diagrams, also cut one corner, off thef bottom of
    each leg, at the complement of the angle that the leg rises when
    standing
    ({{legAngleComplement}}&deg;). (<a href="#figure1b">Figure 1b</a>)

  <h3>Step 2: Drill holes in the legs.</h3>

<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    In each leg, drill three dowel-sized holes through the wide
    face. These should be centered on the width of the leg. Measured
    from the bottom, where you may have cut a corner off, they will be
    at {{bottomLegDowelDistance}}cm, {{middleLegDowelDistance}}cm, and
    {{topLegDowelDistance}}cm. (<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>)
  </p>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1">

  <p>For dowels that pass through two pieces on each side (an arm and
  a leg, two arms, or two legs), secure it only to the outer-most
  piece. The inner piece should move freely around the dowel, to allow
  the rack to fold.</p>
