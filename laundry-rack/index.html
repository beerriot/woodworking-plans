  <p>Hanging wet laundry to dry uses less energy, and is gentler on
  clothing, than heated tumble drying. This rack provides ample space
  to hang several loads, while also folding near-flat for storage.</p>

  <p>For dowels that pass through two pieces on each side (an arm and
  a leg, two arms, or two legs), secure it only to the outer-most
  piece. The inner piece should move freely around the dowel, to allow
  the rack to fold.</p>
