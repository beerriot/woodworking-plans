    Hanging wet laundry to dry uses less energy, and is gentler on
    clothing, than heated tumble drying. This rack provides ample
    space to hang several loads, while also folding near-flat for
    storage.

    Step-by-step instructions for building this laundry rack
    follow. <a href="">A video of this process</a> is also available

    These instructions assume that your square stock (for the legs and
    arms) and the dowels are already the correct width and thickness
    (Legs/arms: {{squareStockWidth}}cm x {{squareStockThickness}}cm,
    dowels {{dowelDiameter}}cm in
    diameter). (<a href="#figure0">Figure 0</a>) The dimensions in
    these plans are the dimensions of commonly-available surfaced
    stock from major hardware stores. If you're starting with
    differently-sized wood, rip the square stock and turn the dowels
    to size before starting.

    In each leg, drill three dowel-sized holes through the wide
    face. These should be centered on the width of the leg. Measured
    from the bottom, where you may have cut a corner off, they will be
    at {{bottomLegDowelDistance}}cm, {{middleLegDowelDistance}}cm, and

    at {{dowelInset}}cm, and the center of each hole after that will
    be {{armHangDowelSpan}}cm from the center of the previous
    hole. (<a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>).

    the small offcuts for use in the next step.

  <h3>Step 6: Paint (optional).</h3>
</div>

  </a>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    Consider sanding and painting (or applying other finish) before
    assembly. It's easier to reach all the places, especially between
    where the legs meet, at this point.
  </p>
  <p>
    Care still needs to be taken to prevent paint from getting where
    it shouldn't be. Tape the the ends of the dowels as shown
    in <a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a>. The last
    {{squareStockThickness}}cm of all short dowels, and
    {{nonPivotLongDowelCount}} long dowels should be left
    unpainted. This unpainted section will be glued in one of the
    holes in an arm or leg. Any paint on it might make the fit too
    tight, or interfere with the glue bond. On the remaining four long
    dowels leave twice that length ({{doubleSquareStockThickness}}cm)
    unpainted. The ends of those dowels will pass through two holes to
    form the pivot points.
  </p>
  <p>
    To keep paint out of the holes in the arms and legs, push the
    off-cuts from trimming your dowels part way into them before
    painting. It should be easy to break any dried paint bond later by
    twisting the dowel stubs with a pair of pliers.

  <h3>Step 7: Assemble the narrow arms.</h3>

    <p><i>Figure 7: Assemble the narrow arms.</i></p>
  </a>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    Apply glue to the first {{outerDowels}} holes in one arm, and to
    one end of {{outerDowels}} short dowels, then fit them into the
    holes. Push them in until the end of the dowel is flush with the
    outside of the arm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Place a long dowel, one with the longer unpainted section if you
    painted in Step 6, into the next whole <i>without glue</i>. The
    arm should spin freely about this dowel after assembly, but don't
    worry if it's just a little tight at the moment. The leverage
    you'll have from pushing at on points in the rack will be able to
    overcome this friction. Push this long dowel through until it
    protrudes one leg thickness out of the other side of the arm. The
    paint will be touching the inside of the arm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tip: Pushing the long dowels through can be a good place to use
    off-cuts from the arms and legs. Lay them flat, put the arm on
    them without blocking the hole, and then push the dowel through
    until it touches the surface you're working on.
  <p>
    Apply glue and insert short dowels into the next {{innerDowels}}
    holes. Then insert one more long dowel, with the longer unpainted
    section, into the final hole, again <i>without glue</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apply glue to the same holes in a second arm, and push it onto the
    other ends of the dowels in the same orientation. Remember: only
    holes with short dowels in them should be glued at this step.
  </p>
  <p>
    Set this assembly aside to dry. (<a href="figure7">Figure 7</a>)

  </a>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    Glue {{nonPivotHangingDowelCount}} long dowels into one of the two
    remaining arms, in the same positions you glued the short dowels
    in step 7. (<a href="figure8">Figure 8</a>) If you painted the
    dowels in step 6, these will all be long dowels with the short
    unpainted section. The ends of the dowels should be flush with the
    outside of the arm. Leave the two pivot holes empty for tnow, and
    do not attach the remaining arm to the other end of these dowels
    yet. Set this partial assembly aside to dry.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 9: Assemble one side of the legs.</h3>

  </a>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    Glue a short dowel into the bottom hole of one leg (the hole that
    is {{bottomDowelDistance}} from the end). Glue a long dowel, one
    with the short unpainted section if you painted them in Step 6,
    into the bottom hole of a second leg.
  </p>
  <p>
    Push a long dowel, one with the long unpainted section if you
    painted them in Step 6, through the middle hole of the leg with
    the short dowel attached, until it sticks out
    {{squareStockThickness}}cm. Apply glue to the middle hole of the
    leg with the long dowel attached, and then push the protruding bit
    of middle dowel into this glued hole. If you cut the corner off
    the bottom of the legs in Step 1, be careful to orient this second
    leg correctly: the cutoff corners should face each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is any glue between the two legs, or on the dowel inside
    the outer leg, clean it up before it dries. The goal is to glue
    the middle dowel to only the leg that has the long dowel
    attached. The leg with the short dowel attached should pivot
    freely about the middle dowel.
  </p>

<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    Tip: It's easiest to finish the assembly with the structure laying
    on its side. This is another good place to use off-cuts from the
    arms and legs. Lay them flat beneath the ends of the leg that is
    otherwise supported only in the middle, to keep the assembly from
    rocking.n
  </p>
  <p>
    Push the remaining long dowel (it should be one with the wider
    unpainted section) through the top hole of the leg that had the
    short dowel attached to its bottom hole in Step 9. It should
    protrude from the opposite side {{squareStockThickness}}cm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apply glue to the inner skipped hole in the unfinished wide arm
    assembly from Step 8. Push the end of the dowel protruding from
    the top of the leg into this hole. As before, clean up any errant
    glue so that the dowel is only glued to the arm, and the leg can
    still move freely.

    the wide arms. Push the end of the long dowels protruding from the
    narrow arm assembly into these holes. The dowel at the end of the
    assembly goes into the hole in the other arm assembly, and the
    dowel in the middle goes into the hole in the leg.

    apply glue to the top or middle holes. Push this leg onto the
    three dowels protruding from the leg that is connected to the
    unfinished arm assembly (the one still waiting for its second
    arm). The dowel in the bottom hole should be flush with the
    outside of the leg, and the other dowels should stick through
    {{squareStockThickness}}cm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be careful to match the cutoff at the bottom (if you made it in
    Step 1) to the cutoff on the leg at the other end of these dowels.

  <p>
    The final arm and leg can be attached in either order. For each
    component, apply glue to each of its holes, and press onto the
    dowels protruding from its matching component. All dowels should
    sit flush with the outer edge.
  </p>
  <p>
    When attaching the leg, be careful to orient the cutoff at the
    bottom (if you made it in Step 1) in the correct direction. It
    should match the piece at the other end of its dowels.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="pure-u-1">

  <p>For dowels that pass through two pieces on each side (an arm and
  a leg, two arms, or two legs), secure it only to the outer-most
  piece. The inner piece should move freely around the dowel, to allow
  the rack to fold.</p>
