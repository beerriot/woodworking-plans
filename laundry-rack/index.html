    Hanging wet laundry to dry uses less energy, and is gentler on
    clothing, than heated tumble drying. This rack provides ample
    space to hang several loads, while also folding near-flat for
    storage.

    Step-by-step instructions for building this laundry rack
    follow. <a href="">A video of this process</a> is also available

    These instructions assume that your square stock (for the legs and
    arms) and the dowels are already the correct width and thickness
    (Legs/arms: {{squareStockWidth}}cm x {{squareStockThickness}}cm,
    dowels {{dowelDiameter}}cm in
    diameter). (<a href="#figure0">Figure 0</a>) The dimensions in
    these plans are the dimensions of commonly-available surfaced
    stock from major hardware stores. If you're starting with
    differently-sized wood, rip the square stock and turn the dowels
    to size before starting.

    If you want the dowels in the arms to hang at exactly the height
    shown in the diagrams, also cut one corner, off thef bottom of
    each leg, at the complement of the angle that the leg rises when
    standing
    ({{legAngleComplement}}&deg;). (<a href="#figure1b">Figure 1b</a>)

    In each leg, drill three dowel-sized holes through the wide
    face. These should be centered on the width of the leg. Measured
    from the bottom, where you may have cut a corner off, they will be
    at {{bottomLegDowelDistance}}cm, {{middleLegDowelDistance}}cm, and
    {{topLegDowelDistance}}cm. (<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>)

    In each arm, drill {{armDowelHoleCount}} dowel-sized holes through
    the wide face. These should be centered on the width of the
    arm. Measured from one end, the center of the first hole will be
    at {{dowelInset}}cm, and the center of each hole after that will
    be {{armHangDowelSpan}}cm from the center of the previous
    hole. (<a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>).

    the small offcuts for use in the next step.

  <h3>Step 6: Paint (optional).</h3>

</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    Consider sanding and painting (or applying other finish) before
    assembly. It's easier to reach all the places, especially between
    where the legs meet, at this point.
  </p>
  <p>
    Care still needs to be taken to prevent paint from getting where
    it shouldn't be. Tape the the ends of the dowels as shown
    in <a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a>. The last
    {{squareStockThickness}}cm of all short dowels, and
    {{nonPivotLongDowelCount}} long dowels should be left
    unpainted. This unpainted section will be glued in one of the
    holes in an arm or leg. Any paint on it might make the fit too
    tight, or interfere with the glue bond. On the remaining four long
    dowels leave twice that length ({{doubleSquareStockThickness}}cm)
    unpainted. The ends of those dowels will pass through two holes to
    form the pivot points.
  </p>
  <p>
    To keep paint out of the holes in the arms and legs, push the
    off-cuts from trimming your dowels part way into them before
    painting. It should be easy to break any dried paint bond later by
    twisting the dowel stubs with a pair of pliers.
  </p>
</div>



<div class="pure-u-1">

  <p>For dowels that pass through two pieces on each side (an arm and
  a leg, two arms, or two legs), secure it only to the outer-most
  piece. The inner piece should move freely around the dowel, to allow
  the rack to fold.</p>
