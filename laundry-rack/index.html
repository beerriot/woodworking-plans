    Hanging wet laundry to dry uses less energy, and is gentler on
    clothing, than heated tumble drying. This rack provides ample
    space to hang several loads, while also folding near-flat for
    storage.

    Step-by-step instructions for building this laundry rack
    follow. <a href="">A video of this process</a> is also available

    These instructions assume that your square stock (for the legs and
    arms) and the dowels are already the correct width and thickness
    (Legs/arms: {{site.data.laundry-rack.squareStockWidth}}cm x
    {{site.data.laundry-rack.squareStockThickness}}cm, dowels
    {{site.data.laundry-rack.dowelDiameter}}cm in
    diameter). (<a href="#figure0">Figure 0</a>) The dimensions in
    these plans are the dimensions of commonly-available surfaced
    stock from major hardware stores. If you're starting with
    differently-sized wood, rip the square stock and turn the dowels
    to size before starting.

<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    Consider sanding and painting (or applying other finish) before
    assembly. It's easier to reach all the places, especially between
    where the legs meet, at this point.
  </p>
  <p>
    Care still needs to be taken to prevent paint from getting where
    it shouldn't be. Tape the the ends of the dowels as shown
    in <a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a>. The last
    {{site.data.laundry-rack.squareStockThickness}}cm of all short
    dowels, and {{site.data.laundry-rack.nonPivotLongDowelCount}} long
    dowels should be left unpainted. This unpainted section will be
    glued in one of the holes in an arm or leg. Any paint on it might
    make the fit too tight, or interfere with the glue bond. On the
    remaining four long dowels leave twice that length
    ({{site.data.laundry-rack.doubleSquareStockThickness}}cm)
    unpainted. The ends of those dowels will pass through two holes to
    form the pivot points.
  </p>
  <p>
    To keep paint out of the holes in the arms and legs, push the
    off-cuts from trimming your dowels part way into them before
    painting. It should be easy to break any dried paint bond later by
    twisting the dowel stubs with a pair of pliers.

    <p><i>Figure 7: Assemble the narrow arms.</i></p>
  </a>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    Apply glue to the first {{site.data.laundry-rack.outerDowels}}
    holes in one arm, and to one end of
    {{site.data.laundry-rack.outerDowels}} short dowels, then fit them
    into the holes. Push them in until the end of the dowel is flush
    with the outside of the arm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Place a long dowel, one with the longer unpainted section if you
    painted in Step 6, into the next whole <i>without glue</i>. The
    arm should spin freely about this dowel after assembly, but don't
    worry if it's just a little tight at the moment. The leverage
    you'll have from pushing at on points in the rack will be able to
    overcome this friction. Push this long dowel through until it
    protrudes one leg thickness out of the other side of the arm. The
    paint will be touching the inside of the arm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tip: Pushing the long dowels through can be a good place to use
    off-cuts from the arms and legs. Lay them flat, put the arm on
    them without blocking the hole, and then push the dowel through
    until it touches the surface you're working on.
  <p>
    Apply glue and insert short dowels into the next
    {{site.data.laundry-rack.innerDowels}} holes. Then insert one more
    long dowel, with the longer unpainted section, into the final
    hole, again <i>without glue</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apply glue to the same holes in a second arm, and push it onto the
    other ends of the dowels in the same orientation. Remember: only
    holes with short dowels in them should be glued at this step.
  </p>
  <p>
    Set this assembly aside to dry. (<a href="figure7">Figure 7</a>)

    Glue {{site.data.laundry-rack.nonPivotHangingDowelCount}} long
    dowels into one of the two remaining arms, in the same positions
    you glued the short dowels in step 7. (<a href="figure8">Figure
    8</a>) If you painted the dowels in step 6, these will all be long
    dowels with the short unpainted section. The ends of the dowels
    should be flush with the outside of the arm. Leave the two pivot
    holes empty for tnow, and do not attach the remaining arm to the
    other end of these dowels yet. Set this partial assembly aside to
    dry.

  <p>
    Glue a short dowel into the bottom hole of one leg (the hole that
    is {{site.data.laundry-rack.bottomLegDowelDistance}} from the
    end). Glue a long dowel, one with the short unpainted section if
    you painted them in Step 6, into the bottom hole of a second leg.
  </p>
  <p>
    Push a long dowel, one with the long unpainted section if you
    painted them in Step 6, through the middle hole of the leg with
    the short dowel attached, until it sticks out
    {{site.data.laundry-rack.squareStockThickness}}cm. Apply glue to
    the middle hole of the leg with the long dowel attached, and then
    push the protruding bit of middle dowel into this glued hole. If
    you cut the corner off the bottom of the legs in Step 1, be
    careful to orient this second leg correctly: the cutoff corners
    should face each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is any glue between the two legs, or on the dowel inside
    the outer leg, clean it up before it dries. The goal is to glue
    the middle dowel to only the leg that has the long dowel
    attached. The leg with the short dowel attached should pivot
    freely about the middle dowel.

  <p>
    Tip: It's easiest to finish the assembly with the structure laying
    on its side. This is another good place to use off-cuts from the
    arms and legs. Lay them flat beneath the ends of the leg that is
    otherwise supported only in the middle, to keep the assembly from
    rocking.n
  </p>
  <p>
    Push the remaining long dowel (it should be one with the wider
    unpainted section) through the top hole of the leg that had the
    short dowel attached to its bottom hole in Step 9. It should
    protrude from the opposite side
    {{site.data.laundry-rack.squareStockThickness}}cm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apply glue to the inner skipped hole in the unfinished wide arm
    assembly from Step 8. Push the end of the dowel protruding from
    the top of the leg into this hole. As before, clean up any errant
    glue so that the dowel is only glued to the arm, and the leg can
    still move freely.

    three dowels protruding from the leg that is connected to the
    unfinished arm assembly (the one still waiting for its second
    arm). The dowel in the bottom hole should be flush with the
    outside of the leg, and the other dowels should stick through
    {{site.data.laundry-rack.squareStockThickness}}cm.

    When attaching the leg, be careful to orient the cutoff at the

    Stand the rack up, and try opening and closing it. If your dowels
    fit their holes tightly, the movement may be stiff at first. Over
    time it should loosen up. If your rack doesn't sit without
    rocking, or doesn't fold evenly (i.e. one side sticks out farther
    than the other), it may be that some of the holes are not
    aligned. In that case, check all distances between dowels and ends
    of arms and legs. If one or more is off, cut the dowel off, drill
    a new hole in the correct position, and insert a new dowel.
  </p>

</div>
<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p>
    To keep the rack from folding up when weight - like wet laundry -
    is applied to the arms, a simple lock can be made from some
    paracord (or other strong string, twine, etc.) and a hook large
    enough to hang on one of the dowels. Tie the hook to
    {{site.data.laundry-rack.pivotVerticalSpan}}cm, plus enough extra
    length for a knotted loop on either end, of paracord.
  <p>
    Open the rack so that the arms are parallel to the ground, or so
    that the ends of the arms are just slightly higher. Place the hook
    around the dowel in the middle of the legs, and then run the line
    up over the dowel connecting the arm assemblies. Tie the line
    around this dowel so that the line is taught.
  </p>
  <p>
    Repeat this process for a second hook-and-line lock. Push one lock
    to one side, and the other lock to the other side. This will
    balance out the pressure across the rack, and decrease the
    potential for a dowel to snap.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try pushing on the ends of the arms. If your knots hold, the rack
    shouldn't collapse. To fold up the rack, raise the ends of the
    arms far enough above parallel to allow the hooks to swing free of
    the center leg dowel. Move the hooks out of the way - I like to
    hook them one one of the arm dowels - and press down on the arms
    to fold up the rack.
